The following scripts can be used to reproduce the results reported in the paper:

- Ne_count.m: Calculate N_e numbers under different distance measures and kernels as shown in Figure 1, 4 and Table 1.
- VDM.m: Generating results for Figure 1 (b)
- testIR.m: The retrieval precision of 5 nearest neighbour as shown in Table 2
- testIndexing.ipynb: Brute force vs Ball tree index as shown in Table 2
- testclustering.m: Clustering evaluation results in Table 3
- testTSNE.m: t-SNE visulaisation as shown in Table 5 and Table 6
- EstimateID.m: Estimated intrinsic dimensions as shown in Figure 3
- Hubness.m: Calculation for Figure5
- IKtransformation.m: Transform the original data to IK feature space for indexing and SVM classification. 
- SVMclassification.ipynb: SVM classification for Table 4



Please unzip the datasets under "Clustering and Indexing datasets" before running these scripts. All datasets used for SVM classification in Table 4 can be directly obtained from https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/datasets/. The script to read the original data in the SVM format can be obtained from https://github.com/cjlin1/libsvm.



The codes for indexing search and SVM classification evaluation are implemented in Python, other tasks are based on Matlab.
